# Turtle

Implementing (parts of) the [Logo Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)#Turtle_and_graphics)

## ToDo / Ideas

- [ ] Buttons to pre-load other examples (house, star...)
- [ ] Animate the turtle
- [ ] Share "snippets" (pass its b64 through the URL)
- [ ] Turtle commands builder: add commands dynamically, with sliders for the
      amount (distance/angle)
- [ ] Add a construct for loops
- [ ] Additional Turtle commands: PenUp/PenDown, PenColor...
